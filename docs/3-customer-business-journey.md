### 🧭 **Section 1: What is a Customer Journey?**

**Definition**:  
A **Customer Journey** is the path a user takes while interacting with a digital product or service, focusing on their **experience** and **actions**.

**Key Characteristics**:
- Begins with a user’s **intent** (e.g., searching for a product)
- Involves **digital touchpoints** (e.g., search, click, add to cart)
- Ends when the user completes a **goal** (e.g., placing an order)

**Example**:  
> A user visits a retail website, searches for a laptop, reads reviews, adds it to their cart, and places an order.

🧩 **Think About It**:  
What steps do you take when buying something online? That’s your customer journey!

### 🏢 **Section 2: What is a Business Journey?**

**Definition**:  
A **Business Journey** is the **end-to-end operational process** that begins with a customer interaction and ends with a **business outcome**.

**Key Characteristics**:
- Triggered by a customer action (e.g., order placed)
- Involves **backend systems** (e.g., payment, inventory, shipping)
- Ends with a **business result** (e.g., item delivered, revenue recorded)

**Example**:  
> After the customer places the order, the system processes payment, locates the item in inventory, ships it, and confirms delivery.

🧩 **Think About It**:  
What happens behind the scenes after you click “Buy Now”? That’s the business journey!
