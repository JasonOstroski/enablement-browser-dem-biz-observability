## Understanding Customer vs Business Journeys

**Goals**

- Define what a **Customer Journey** is
- Define what a **Business Journey** is
- Distinguish between the two using real-world examples
- Understand how both journeys contribute to digital success

### Customer Journey

🧭 **What is a Customer Journey?**

**Definition**:

A **Customer Journey** is the path a user takes while interacting with a digital product or service, focusing on their **experience** and **actions**.

**Key Characteristics**:

- Begins with a user’s **intent** (e.g., searching for a product)
- Involves **digital touchpoints** (e.g., search, click, add to cart)
- Ends when the user completes a **goal** (e.g., placing an order)

**Example**:  
> A user visits a retail website, searches for a laptop, reads reviews, adds it to their cart, and places an order.

🧩 **Think About It**:  
What steps do you take when buying something online? That’s your customer journey!

### Business Journey

🏢 **What is a Business Journey?**

**Definition**:

A **Business Journey** is the **end-to-end operational process** that begins with a customer interaction and ends with a **business outcome**.

**Key Characteristics**:

- Triggered by a customer action (e.g., order placed)
- Involves **backend systems** (e.g., payment, inventory, shipping)
- Ends with a **business result** (e.g., item delivered, revenue recorded)

**Example**:  
> After the customer places the order, the system processes payment, locates the item in inventory, ships it, and confirms delivery.
